# TitanicKaggle
Overview
The data has been split into two groups:

training set (train_titanic.csv)
test set (test_titanic.csv)
The training set should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the “ground truth”) for each passenger. 
The test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data.
